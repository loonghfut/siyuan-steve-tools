**STEVETOOLS**  
==========  
This is a collection of tools.  

#### Current Tools  
1. **Calendar Subscription**:  
   Used to generate `.ics` calendar files, enabling synchronization of schedules with calendar software that supports URL subscriptions, such as Thunderbird and Xiaomi Calendar.  
2. **Docker Sync Awareness**:  
   After S3 synchronization on the Windows side, the Docker side can detect the S3 sync. Currently, only Docker-side awareness is supported.  
3. **AI Web Sidebar**:  
   Embeds some AI web pages for convenient use.  

For specific usage instructions, please refer to the plugin settings page.
