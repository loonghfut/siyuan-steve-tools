STEVETOOLS
==========
This is a collection of personal tools. While I use it myself, I hope to share it and help others with relevant needs. 
(Note: Because it is a self-use tool plug-in, there may be some imperfections and even data loss!! (Because you use the API related to Siyuan Data Operation), please test it yourself and use it if there is no problem. At the same time, this plug-in is completely open source)   
 Do not use if you mind.
### If you find a BUG or have good suggestions, you are welcome to mention issue or pr.
#### Current tools
1. Schedule Management 2.0(beta):   [Related Demonstration](https://ld246.com/article/1737464243546?r=stevehfut)   
The calendar view deeply integrated with Siyuan is also used to generate calendar file ics to synchronize schedules to calendar software that supports url subscriptions, such as thunderbird, Xiaomi Calendar, etc.
2. docker synchronous sensing:  
After the win side s3 is synchronized, the docker side senses the s3 synchronization. Currently, only docker-end sensing is supported.
3. ai webpage sidebar:  
Some ai web pages are embedded for easy use.
